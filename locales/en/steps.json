  "StepDescriptionParagraph3": "Once you're happy with your webpage design, we'll set up your email. We'll also set up any services included in your business kit that don't need user verification. This ensures a seamless transition and gets you up and running quickly. We'll also acquire and set up the domain of your webpage.
